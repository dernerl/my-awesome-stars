# 🌟 My Awesome Stars

This repository contains my curated list of awesome starred repositories, automatically generated and organized by programming language.

> **Note:** This list is automatically updated every Monday using the [mawesome](https://github.com/simonecorsi/mawesome) GitHub Action.

## 🔄 How it works

1. The GitHub Action runs weekly (every Monday at 6 AM)
2. It fetches all my starred repositories via GitHub API
3. Organizes them by programming language
4. Updates this README.md automatically

## 🚀 Manual Update

You can manually trigger an update by going to the [Actions tab](../../actions) and running the "Update Awesome List" workflow.
